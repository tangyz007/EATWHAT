# EATWHAT
2021 Hackathon project

## Inspiration
A lot of people don't know that we can actually order special meals on the plane.  So we want to make it easier for customers to order a meal and help the attendant to better serve and promote their services to provide meals.
## What it does
It helps to promote the special meal options to customers and improve the user experience by sending SMS to eligible customers.
## How we built it
Using node.js and mongodb as our backend and react.js as the front end, we also implement the AA flight engine API and twilio SMS API.
## Challenges we ran into
Design DB schema and debug
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a full-stack project by ourselves and push it on to the Heroku cloud!
## What we learned
New tech stack and great teamwork!
## What's next for EATWHAT
Mobile version, UI customization, and more useful meal ordering features!
